<i><h1>&quot;WARDENES EUNT DOMUS&quot;</h1></i>

<p class="youya-p">The HORDE isn't just about reclaiming Caoiva from the Wardens, it is about setting an example. When Colonials think of what encompasses prestige, their minds immediately go to the HORDE. And you can be a part of that too â€” just enlist!</p>
<p class="youya-p">With credentials like that, what more could you ask for? Are you cut out to be part of the finest Colonial regiment? Enlist now and see if you make the cut!</p>

<p class="youya-p">Armor of all kinds are best used when HORDE are the crew! We make the plays that break the Warden lines and their resolve. Nor are the Wardens are not safe on the blue seas when the HORDE is around! Fielding boats and ships of all sizes, you can be certain that Caoiva cannot sleep with the HORDE at bay.</p>

<h2 id="ordnance">Ordnance</h2>

<p class="youya-p">We recognize the potency of artillery and ensure that we rain down as much of it on the Wardens as we can. You can find HORDE on all ends of the supply chain, from gathering sulfur to manufacturing shells to making craters on Caoivan lands. Take part in massive rocket barrages, artillery strikes that run for hours, coastal bombardments from ships, and even the occasional nuke.</p>

<h2 id="resupply">Resupply</h2>

<p class="youya-p">When the HORDE adopt a resource, they make it count! While other regiments expect others to pick up the slack, the HORDE outshines all through its integration of procurement of resources, production of armaments, and dispersion of hell across Caoiva. We cover it all, from the scrap field to the frontline base.</p>

<h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>

<p class="youya-p">You can be rest assured that when the HORDE is on the frontline, it holds; we don't lose focus of the bigger picture. While we specialize at finding the weak points in Warden defenses, we ensure that we don't let the Wardens slip by our own lines. Ever vigilant, the HORDE keep the Caoivan menace on his toes!</p>

<h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>

<p class="youya-p">Simply put, the Caoivan does not get through HORDE defenses. From Market Road to Teichotima to Keelhaul to Breaker Town and beyond, wherever the HORDE break ground, the Wardens do not pass! Our relentless efforts to make safe haven for Colonials forces, whether on the offense or defense, bring forth bases that strike fear into the enemy and invoke awe among fellow Meseans. The Colonials know it. The Wardens know it too!</p>
